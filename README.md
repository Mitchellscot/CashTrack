# CashTrack
![CashTrack](src/wwwroot/images/cash-track.png)

This is a budgeting app.

Work in progress.

scss files are compiled when the project is build (see the npm run dev script) however you can use hot reload by editing the .css files directly in wwwroot/css

you can also open another terminal and run npx sass --update --watch ./Styles:wwwroot/css and edit the .scss files and see the changes go live immediately
